Franc: Today we are going to learn a very important type of magic.
Franc: Time magic.
Claude: Sir, my mom says I'm not allowed to do time magic.
Franc: Yes, time magic can be very dangerous.
Franc: Which is why we must practice the fundamentals.
Franc: This is the part where we would learn lots of words if we had time.
Franc: But we don't have time!
You instantly gained all knowledge of days of the week and months.
