To do:
-hide audio button on dictionary for first open
-Test camera scaling
-FIND A GOOD FONT
-add all audio clips
-Improve dictionary efficiency
	-Apply fix to similar scripts
-camera and player bounds
	-probably just going to get rid of them altogether?
-consistent sprites
	-working on this
-magic system
-relationship system
-UI for inventory/calendar

Would like to:

-Add colours to transitions for day/night cycle
-quest archive
-change dialogue UI
	-picture of who's speaking?
-character customization

Waiting to:
-fix collisions
	-Can't be done until all maps are completed since the collisions reset when re-importing updated maps

Finished:
-fix audio for dictionary
-Camera scaling
-fixed jerky animation
	-due mostly to startup processes of scripts which would not occur in actual 
	 gameplay since the startups would run while player loads in from main menu
	-moved the physics parts of player movement to a fixed update loop which seems to have helped
-Added objective class for quests (quest steps)
